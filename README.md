# SpaceApps 2017

# Welcome to the 3DNasa github project page!

## Challenge

We decided to give the `1D, 2D, 3D - GO!` challenge a try! Our app comes as a revolutionary step to teaching, where people that are not generally attracted to the idea of learning about our environment and its evolution can easily discover new ways to interact with our world, its history and the different layers of information available. All of it with some predefined gestures such as `right palm up` to swith to a night vision of the world and `left hand fist` to go back 1 month each time the gesture is being triggered reloading the already added layers to see how the world has changed in that given month.

All of this is being used with GIBS data layers information, WebGL, Leaflet and of course Leap Motion.

## How to run the project
1. Run `npm run init`
1. Run `gulp serve-dev`
1. If the browser doesn't load automatically go to localhost:3000 and enjoy!
